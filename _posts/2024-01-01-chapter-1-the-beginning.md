# Welcome to Prajna

This is the first chapter of our book, written in **Jekyll format** markdown. The system will render this into beautiful HTML pages that look like a real book.

## What is Prajna?

Prajna is a static site generator that takes markdown files from the `_posts` folder and converts them into HTML pages. Each post is rendered with a book-like layout, making it perfect for:

- Writing books
- Creating documentation
- Building knowledge bases
- Publishing long-form content

## Features

The system supports all standard markdown features:

### Lists

1. Ordered lists
2. With multiple items
3. Like this one

And unordered lists:

- Bullet points
- Another bullet
- And another

### Code Blocks

You can include inline `code` or full code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Prajna!")
```

### Quotes

## Getting Started

To use Prajna, simply:

1. Create markdown files in the `_posts` folder
2. Use Jekyll front matter (YAML between `---` markers)
3. Run the `prajna.py` script
4. Find your rendered HTML in the `_site` folder

That's it! Your content will be beautifully formatted and ready to share.
