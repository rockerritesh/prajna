# Shree Ganesh

Every meaningful journey begins with remembrance of **Shree Ganesh**, the revered deity known as the *Remover of Obstacles* and the *Lord of Beginnings*. In Indian tradition, no book, ritual, or important work starts without first invoking Ganesh.

## Who is Shree Ganesh?

Shree Ganesh, also known as **Ganapati** or **Vinayaka**, is the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. He is easily recognized by his elephant head, symbolizing:

- **Wisdom and intelligence**
- **Strength with gentleness**
- **Deep listening and understanding**

Ganesh teaches us that true power lies in balance—between intellect and humility.

## Why We Begin with Ganesh

In spiritual and literary traditions, Ganesh is worshipped first because he:

- Removes obstacles from the path
- Grants clarity of thought
- Blesses new beginnings
- Guides learning and creativity

For this reason, this work humbly starts with his name.

## Symbolism of Ganesh

Each part of Ganesh carries meaning:

- **Elephant head** → Wisdom and foresight  
- **Large ears** → Listen more, speak less  
- **Small eyes** → Focus and concentration  
- **Broken tusk** → Sacrifice for higher purpose  
- **Modak (sweet)** → Reward of knowledge and discipline  

## Ganesh Mantra

A simple invocation often recited before starting any work:

```text
ॐ गं गणपतये नमः
Om Gam Ganapataye Namaha
````

This mantra invokes inner strength and removes mental and external barriers.

## A Spiritual Beginning

Just as this book begins with intention, reflection, and purpose, remembering Shree Ganesh reminds us to move forward with:

* Humility
* Patience
* Wisdom
* Devotion

May Shree Ganesh bless this journey with success, understanding, and peace.
