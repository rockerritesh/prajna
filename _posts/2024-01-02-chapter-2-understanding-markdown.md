# Markdown Syntax Guide

In this chapter, we'll explore the various markdown features supported by Prajna.

## Headers

You can create headers at different levels using `#` symbols:

# H1 Header
## H2 Header
### H3 Header

## Text Formatting

Make text **bold** or *italic*. You can also combine them: ***bold and italic***.

## Links and Images

Create [links to other pages](https://example.com) easily.

Images work too:
```
![Alt text](image.jpg)
```

## Tables

Markdown supports tables as well:

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Markdown parsing | ✓ | High |
| HTML rendering | ✓ | High |
| Book layout | ✓ | High |
| Code highlighting | ✓ | Medium |

## Advanced Features

### Nested Lists

1. First item
   - Sub-item A
   - Sub-item B
2. Second item
   - Another sub-item
     - Even deeper!
